2. Many small programs
3. Input-Output redirection

ls -r reverse the ordering

Unix Naming Conventions
=======================

In general, don't use spaces in the sames of things (use dashes or underscores to separate words)
  -for the shell, underscore is usually preferred

Prefer lowercase letters in naming files and directories
